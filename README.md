# Mesh Baker
A small library to bake skinned meshes

This is currently *NOT* production ready. Unless you are deving on it or are an elite coder looking to read through some example bake code, this will not do anything for you.

# Quick Start (library)
```bash
npm install meshbaker
```

# Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies with legacy peer deps flag to ignore React errors
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev

# Or just use yarn
yarn install
yarn run dev
```
